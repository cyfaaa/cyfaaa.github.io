We build trustworthy Digital Twin (DT) networks leveraging blockchain, verifiable data pipelines, and edge computing. The design focuses on identity, provenance, and cross-domain synchronization to support large-scale DTs in Metaverse and cyber-physical systems.

- Decentralized identity and attestation for Twins and assets
- Verifiable, low-latency synchronization via edge computing
- Cross-domain interoperability and auditability
