MAP Protocol is an omnichain infrastructure connecting Bitcoin, multi-chain stablecoins, and tokenized assets with a trust-minimized, peer-to-peer design. It leverages Light Client verification and MPC-based Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to enable secure, end-to-end cross-chain swaps without trusted third parties.

- Light clients with ZK-proof acceleration ensure on-chain, source-of-truth verification.
- MPC-TSS orchestrated by distributed validators prevents single points of failure.
- EVM compatible, enabling seamless dApp development across chains.
